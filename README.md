# Airdrop SOL into wallet based on nft count<br/>

A NodeJS Application to airdrop SOL to users wallet based on NFTs Count for a particular collection.

Contact [@statikdev](https://twitter.com/statikdev) for snapshot of wallets for a particular collection<br/><br/>


Usecase - If you have a royalty wallet for NFT holders and have snapshot of wallets taken and wants to airdrop SOL then use this repo.

This has been tested on Devnet and Mainnet both but I would recommend you to first do the setup and try on devnet and then try on mainnet. 


## Must have installed

[Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)<br/>
[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)<br/>


## How to use

- yarn 
- yarn build

- Solana config get - To check which RPC you are connected to
- Solana config set --url "mainnet-beta" - To connect to mainnet for usage
- Solana config set --url "devnet" - To connect to devnet for usage


## How to use commands

- create_compatible_format -Contact @statikdev for snaphot for the particular collection and then create a folder and use that path to create a compatible format to airdrop or If you have a json file in this format then you can skip the first part and create a folder results and  create a json file in below format and name this file as airdrop_pubKeys.json
 ``` JSON
[
    {
        "pubKey": "8mmvKNsCiUnUXacDaMeoxA7PgtNiHqdsRDpBGPZyvST",
        "count": 4
    },
    {
        "pubKey": "ELPPaNSHKLMUXNEkmRazUonocDHjVVZCJ8NuQiLsGyu",
        "count": 4
    },
    {
        "pubKey": "3UvbPQZJM8vtYg28nRMgbdjfZL3YbGaepNikUwn2tQZ",
        "count": 2
    }
]
```
- count_total_items - Counts the total number of items which is generally equals to collection size
- remove_from_list - Create a JSON file with bunch of addresses which needs to be removed from this before processing. Add secondary wallet addresses <br/><br/>

            ]
 ```
         
- count_wallets - Counts the total number of users which are getting airdropped

- verify_balance - Just for verification
- send_sol - To airdrop users SOL based on NFTs they have. Enter the price in this command which we got from calculate_per_wallet_drop.

4. node build/cli.js count_total_items
5. node  build/cli.js count_wallets
6. node build/cli.js calculate_per_wallet_drop -k {WALLET_PATH} -e "devnet"
7. node build/cli.js verify_balance -k {WALLET_PATH} -e "devnet"
8. node build/cli.js send_sol -p  {PRICE_PER_WALLET_PER_ITEM} -k {WALLET_PATH}

```

## Logging

- A results folder would be created which contains the response.json which have all the failed and success tx with signature.
 
 
  Contents of response.json file :
   ```json
  
   [{
        "pubKey": "2mwMU2WTW5vG6z16xx68Ys5BNkmAe5voU7aHZwLbxdMA",
        "price": 0.01,
        "signature": "\nSignature: 3rtUax1eDJr6w8TJv35cE26qjuvpGfTwGC3xy8MbkEGo9iQeZvVyujpQtDpg6kSuKQxhNYWV3iLXe7TvCPanAmNz\n\n",
        "isSuccess": true
    },
    {

 ## Need to work upon
- Better error handling 
- Use sendTransactionWithRetry
